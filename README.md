## Preparation of Synthetic IoMT Data for Cardiac Arrest
Data is the new fuel for every discipline in the modern world. To the best of the author's knowledge, in eHealth, the availability of IoMT data that helps researchers train their AI models for the prediction of cardiac arrest is not readily available. . A easily available and freely accessible dataset is the most important need for investigating any given area. To compensate for this, the present study conducts extensive research in this area to provide a synthesis dataset that eHealth researchers may use to test their AI/ML model. We have selected a particular medical condition, "cardiac arrest," for which we are producing synthesized IoMT data. This document will include all valid ranges of medical sensors (IoMT) for a subject in various scenarios (patient). The offered range is based on studies published in peer-reviewed publications and papers that have been vetted by well-established practitioners in this medical sector and may be used to build any amount of the synthetic dataset for cardiac arrest depending on the needs of the researcher.

##Dataset Description:

For this dataset, we have considered pulse rate, breathing rate, distance traveled, speed, and Oxygen level in the blood as input features to predict the binary target class of cardiac arrest. Because of the unavailability of the IoMT data, we have created this synthetic IoMT dataset of two individuals with 120000 instances in each dataset.
